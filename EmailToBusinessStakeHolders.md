**Subject:** Data Quality Insights & Next Steps for Receipt Processing

# Hi [Product/Business Leader's Name],

I wanted to share some key insights from our recent analysis of receipt and brand data. We have identified several data quality issues that may impact reporting accuracy, user incentives, and overall data reliability. Below is a summary of our findings and proposed next steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Quality Issues Identified
The analysis revealed several data quality issues, summarized below:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Values
| Field         | Missing Count | Impact |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| last_login   | 62           | Some users have never logged in, making it difficult to track engagement. |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Invalid Values
| Field  | Invalid Count | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| state  | 87           | Some users have invalid or unrecognized state values, which affects regional analytics. |
| role   | 82           | Some users have roles other than "consumer," which may affect role-based access or segmentation. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Data Quality Issues Identified
The analysis revealed a significant data quality issue:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Values
| Field      | Missing Count | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| brand_code | 35          | Affects unique identification and tracking of brands. |

|                 | points_awarded_date   | 582        | Points awarded timestamp missing. |
| **Incorrect Data Types** | purchased_item_count | 1119  | Stored as a string instead of an integer. |
|                 | points_earned         | 1119       | Stored as string instead of integer. |
|                 | bonus_points_earned   | 1119       | Stored as string instead of integer. |
| **Duplicate Records** | -                     | 0          | No duplicate receipts found. |

### üè∑Ô∏è Receipt Items Table (fact_receipt_items)
| Issue Type       | Column    | Occurrences | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Missing Values** | barcode  | 3851       | Item barcode missing, unable to link product. |
|                 | quantity  | 174        | No quantity specified for the receipt item. |
|                 | price     | 174        | Missing price per unit for an item. |
| **Incorrect Data Types** | -       | 0          | No incorrect types found. |
| **Duplicate Records** | -         | 0          | No duplicate items found. |

## **How We Discovered These Issues:**
- Conducted exploratory analysis using **SQL queries** to check for `NULL` values and type mismatches.
- Compared `fact_receipts` against `dim_users` and `fact_receipt_items` against `dim_brands` to detect foreign key violations.
- Reviewed aggregate trends in receipts to identify outliers and inconsistencies in total spend calculations.

---

## **Questions & Next Steps:**
- Are there known business rules around **when purchase dates might be missing**? Should we infer from scanned dates?
- Should we **default unknown users and brands to a specific placeholder** or investigate missing data further?
- Do we have guidelines on **handling incorrect data types** for reward points calculations?

---

## **Optimization & Scaling Considerations:**
- **Indexing & Query Optimization:** We anticipate performance challenges as data scales. Adding indexes on `scanned_date`, `purchase_date`, and `brand_id` will improve query speeds.
- **Data Volume Growth:** With increasing receipts, we may need **partitioning strategies** to ensure faster aggregations.
- **Data Governance:** A more structured **data validation pipeline** before insertion could reduce data inconsistencies.

## **Final Thoughts:**
Improving data quality will enhance **reward calculations, reporting accuracy, and user insights**. Let‚Äôs align on key decisions around handling missing values and optimizing data storage.

Happy to discuss further!
