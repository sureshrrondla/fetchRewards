# Data Warehouse Model for Receipts, Users, and Brands

## Overview
This document outlines the **relational data model** for structuring **Users, Receipts, and Brands** data in a **data warehouse**. The model is designed to support analytical queries efficiently by organizing data into **fact and dimension tables** with well-defined relationships.

## üîó Table Relationships
- **`fact_receipts.receipt_user_id`** ‚Üí `dim_users.user_id` (**1-to-Many**)  
- **`fact_receipt_items.item_receipt_id`** ‚Üí `fact_receipts.receipt_id` (**1-to-Many**)  
- **`fact_receipt_items.item_brand_id`** ‚Üí `dim_brands.brand_id` (**Many-to-1**)  

This structure ensures **efficient querying and reporting** for insights like:
- **Total Spend per User**
- **Most Popular Brands**
- **Average Receipt Spend by State**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Rationale
- **Separation of Facts & Dimensions:** Allows efficient queries for aggregations.
- **Primary & Foreign Keys:** Ensure referential integrity.
- **Denormalization in Fact Tables:** Improves performance for analytical workloads.

---

## üìå Next Steps
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization & Indexing**
- Create **indexes on foreign keys** (`user_id`, `brand_id`, `receipt_id`).
- Consider **partitioning fact tables** for scalability.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Validation & Constraints**
- Ensure **`brand_code` is not NULL** in `dim_brands`.
- Enforce **referential integrity** between receipts and users.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ ETL Pipeline Development**
- **Extract:** Load raw JSON data.
- **Transform:** Convert incorrect types, fill missing values.
- **Load:** Insert cleaned data into the warehouse.

---

## üìå Conclusion
This data warehouse model is structured to ensure **efficient querying, data integrity, and scalability**. The combination of **fact and dimension tables** provides a solid foundation for reporting and analytics on **Users, Receipts, and Brands** data.
