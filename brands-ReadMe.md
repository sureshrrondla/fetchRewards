# Data Quality Analysis for Brands Dataset

## Overview
This project analyzes the data quality of a brands dataset, identifying missing values, incorrect data types, and potential issues that could affect data integrity and analytics.

## Data Sources
The dataset consists of JSON files containing brand information. The data is parsed and stored in the **Brands Table**, which includes details such as brand name, category, barcode, brand code, and top brand status.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Quality Issues Identified
The analysis revealed a significant **data quality issue**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing Values**
| Field | Missing Count | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| `brand_code` | **35** | Affects unique identification and tracking of brands. |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Potential Impact of Missing `brand_code`**
- The absence of `brand_code` makes it difficult to **track brands uniquely** across different datasets.
- **Product matching issues** may arise if multiple brands share similar names but lack distinct brand codes.
- **Data integrity concerns**, as missing codes prevent proper integration with partner product files.

---

## üîç How Was This Data Quality Issue Discovered?
A Python script was used to analyze the dataset for:
1. **Missing Values** ‚Äì Checked for `NaN` or empty `brand_code` fields.
2. **Data Integrity Risks** ‚Äì Identified potential issues in brand tracking.

Example code snippet:
```python
missing_brand_code = brands_df['brand_code'].isnull().sum()
print(f"Missing brand_code: {missing_brand_code} occurrences")
```

## üõ† Resolving Missing `brand_code` Issue
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values**
üëâ **Imputation Strategies**
- `brand_code`: If missing, generate a unique identifier based on brand name and ID.
- Assign `"UNKNOWN_BRANDCODE"` for brands without a unique identifier.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Fixing Data Types**
- Ensure `brand_code` follows a standardized format to prevent mismatches.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance & Scaling Considerations**
- **Preprocess JSON before loading into DB** to correct errors early.
- Use **batch processing** for large datasets.
- Implement **data validation checks** at the ingestion stage.

## üîÆ Next Steps
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What Additional Information is Needed?**
- **Brand Identification Rules**: How should missing `brand_code` values be assigned?
- **Standardization Guidelines**: Should `brand_code` be manually reviewed or auto-generated?

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the Next Steps for Optimization?**
- **Data Cleaning Pipeline**: Automate `brand_code` assignment and validation.
- **Database Constraints**: Enforce `NOT NULL` on `brand_code` where applicable.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Track errors in real-time for better data governance.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Future Performance Considerations**
- **Scalability**: JSON processing should be optimized for high-volume ingestion.
- **Storage Optimization**: Large missing value counts can bloat databases.
- **Query Speed**: Missing `brand_code` affects product matching and search performance.

## üìâ Conclusion
This analysis highlights a key **data integrity issue** and proposes solutions for **data cleaning, transformation, and validation**. Addressing this problem will **improve brand tracking, consistency, and overall system performance**.
